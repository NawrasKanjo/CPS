## Code of conduct
**1. How do we plan to collaborate?**  <br>

  

We have gathered ourselves in this group because we are used to working together, dividing the workload accordingly is something we are familiar with. We understand how each and every member thinks/plans to avoid conflicts and build this project from the ground up with everyone contributing as equally as possible. <br>  <br>  

**2. How do we ensure that everyone in our group stays informed about the individual contributions?**  <br>

-  **GitLab Merge Requests and Comments**: When team members make/commit any amount of changes, they should commit with informative comments. If the changes are significant, a merge request will be issued with a reviewer for assurance. This will inform others about the contributions, especially with the addition of Discord webhook (as everyone on the team uses Discord). <br>  <br>

  
-  **Regular Updates & Scheduled Meetings**: The meetings are planned either personaly or on-distance. In these meetings,  we address any issues, plan ahead or work on an assignment together. We also delegate/progress-update tasks. On Discord, we plan meeting times and room bookings within the next two weeks. We also created a shared folder in google drive that contains all documents related to the course, alongside a channel on Discord to share links, files, etc. <br>  <br>

  
**3. How do we ensure knowledge transfer among our team members?**  <br>

During our meetings we will discuss any issues, share knowledge, work together on an assignment or a part of the project, instantaneous help from other team members is provided when someone is stuck and can’t see the bigger picture to solve the problem.

Through Discord, we have a channel where all members share useful links, PDFs, insights and common problems that face them with the software and a method to solve them. At the end of each week, we will conduct a meeting to summarize all kind of useful materials we found through the week and make sure all group members understand it. All team members are motivated to contribute to the discord channel. All kind of resources are highly appreciated. <br>  <br>


**4. What is our usual communication plan?**  <br>

Our main communication channel is Discord, where the channel is divided into several text channels to keep all materials organised. Additionally, we will use GitLab for version control and code collaboration. We will manage our work within a single repository on GitLab, which will allow us to track changes, review code, and oversee our project efficiently. This repository will contain clear instructions and documentation to ensure smooth collaboration among team members. <br>  <br>

**5. How will we solve conflicts?**  <br>

To reduce the risk of conflicts:<br>

-  **Proactive Communication**: We will implement a structured weekly check-in where team members will express concerns and provide updates on their tasks. This will aim to identify potential misunderstandings or disagreements between the team members. <br>

-  **Clear Role Definition**: At the start of the project, clear roles and responsibilities will be defined. This clarity will help prevent overlaps and misunderstandings that could lead to conflicts. <br>


  

**6. How do you plan to ensure responsible use of LLMs in your project and how do you transparently and traceably document the use of LLMs?**  <br>

  

-  **Policy on LLM Use:** Our group acknowledges the power of LLMs as tools for enhancing productivity without supplanting human ingenuity. LLMs will be used for generating ideas and initial drafts, with final decisions resting in human hands, ensuring alignment with ethical considerations of human benefit and responsibility. [1]<br>

-  **Transparent Documentation of LLM Interaction**: A log will be maintained for decision making LLM interactions, including the purpose, outcomes, and team member involved. Annotations in project documentation will highlight LLM contributions, fostering accountability. [1] <br>

-  **Ensuring Traceability**: We will give a special code (i.e. Unique Identifier ) for specific major issues, we use an LLM in our project. It  will help us keep track of where and how we use LLM advice in our work, using a strong system to manage changes. This way, we make sure everyone knows who has made the major changes, following the OECD’s rules. It also lets us easily show why we made certain big decisions based on LLM help, just like the IEEE Global Initiative for Ethical Considerations suggests we should. [1] [2] <br> <br> 

This revised approach strengthens our project's ethical foundation, aligning with the highest ideals of human rights, maximizing benefits, and minimizing risks as we advance. It ensures our project not only succeeds technically but also considers the principles of responsibility, transparency, and ethical governance in artificial intelligence and autonomous systems. <br>  <br>
